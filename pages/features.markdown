# DigitalSkills Features

The easiest way to understand what DigitalSkills has to offer, is to think of it as a *cafetaria system*: you come in, and pick just what you need or like, given your appetite. We give you a menu card from which you can pick the things you want, and we generate that for you. We deliver it in a format, and for a platform you select. We also offer a turn-key Brightspace module you may include in your course on Brightspace, giving you instant access to DigitalSkills in the cloud.

DigitalSkills is a self-paced, self-assessed, need-driven, multi-level, multi-format and multi-platform programming course, with the following characteristics:

* skill set: programming, simple algorithm design
* programming environment: [Python](http://python.org), [Numpy, Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)  
* topic and tags-driven content composition, organized per learning goal;
  - single learning topic per course element
  - on-demand, topic, topic context, tag-driven learning materials composition
  - on-demand format and platform
* graphical display of learning materials, learning goals, complexity and load
* tags-driven contextual support by optional support materials
* use cases and solution skeleton-driven programming project guidance
* hidden test cases-driven [autograding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=16&v=5WUm0QuJdFw&feature=emb_title)
* error and failed test-driven intelligent feedback to student
